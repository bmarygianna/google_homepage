First Odin Project practice project. Building the Google homepage.
GOAL: By the end of this project I will know how to do these things:

"Two ways to move a div around on the page
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
Center an element horizontally
Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)"

My own reflections before beginning (Thurs July 23, 2020, 16:22):
I am not sure I know enough about div elements, but everything else seems pretty straight forward. Here it goes!
